## Development

### Adding a New Card Type

The project includes a custom schematic to generate new card types. To create a new card:

```bash
ng generate card <card-name>
```

This will automatically:
1. Create a new component in the `cards` directory with the proper structure
2. Implement the base card interface
3. Set up the configuration options
4. Register the card in the card factory service
5. Create the necessary service and model files
6. Add translation files

After generation, you can customize the card implementation according to your needs.

### Adding New Features

1. Create necessary components, services, and models
2. Follow Angular best practices and coding standards
3. Add unit tests for new functionality
4. Update translations if needed

### Building for Production

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
